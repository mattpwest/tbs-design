# TBS Design Examples

This repository will be used to build a bunch of simple turn-based-strategy games to act as illustrative
companions for my series of [blog posts about TBS game design](https://chaotik.co.za/tags/game-design/).

## Decision Log

Significant technical decisions should be logged here:
 * 2019/06/05: Use Unity 2019.2 (beta), to gain access to pixel perfect camera in latest LWRP package.

## Licenses

The code is licensed under the GPL to encourage contribution of bug fixes, but keeping the code open for
everyone to learn from.

The tileset used is [Kenney's 1-bit tileset](https://www.kenney.nl/assets/bit-pack) - it has its own
license (CC0 1.0).
